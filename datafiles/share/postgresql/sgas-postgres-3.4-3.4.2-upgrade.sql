-- logic for upgrading the SGAS PostgreSQL schema from version 3.4.0/3.4.1 to 3.4.2
-- SGAS should be stopped when performing this upgrade


-- drop views so we can perform changes (only transfers really needed)
DROP VIEW usagerecords;
DROP VIEW transfers;

-- alter file size to be 8 byte integer instead of 4 byte
ALTER TABLE jobtransferdata ALTER size TYPE bigint;

-- drop functions, need to accmodate bigint transition (only urcreate really needed)
