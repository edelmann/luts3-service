-- Rebuild SGAS aggregation table
-- Running this script can often take a bit of time - often 5-10 minutes
-- Increasing the work_mem parameter to 16-24 MB (from the default 1 MB),
-- can decrease the time significantly.
-- SGAS should NOT be running while this script is running.


-- first clear the aggregation tables
TRUNCATE TABLE uraggregated_data;
TRUNCATE TABLE uraggregated_update;


-- rebuild everything with a single statement
INSERT INTO uraggregated_data;
