    The task of the database interface is to encapsulate the storage, querying
    and optional transformation of usage records in SGAS.

    This is done by providing a small set of methods and functionality which
    should be generic enough to be implementable on a variety of databases (not
    just relational), while also being usefull enough that direct database
    access can be avoided.

    The database should as minumum support all usage record attributes, but
    extended attributes which are used should be supported if at all possible.
