=== Monitoring Registration ===

SGAS provides a simple mechanism which can be used to monitor if a machine has
made any regstrations in a certain interval. SGAS exposes a simple HTTP
interface, which will reply with the number of seconds since the last
registration for a given hostname.

To pull SGAS for information on registration status construct a URL for the
machine that should be checked. For a cluster with the host name
"cluster.example.org", the URL will look like this:

http://accounting.example.org:6143/sgas/monitor/cluster.example.org

Perform a GET on the URL with curl, wget, or similar. Assuming records have
been registered for the host, the response will have code 200 (OK), and have a
JSON payload, like the following:

{"registration_epoch": 43717}

The registration epoch value is the seconds since last registration. It is then
up to the client to decide if this number is big enough to issue a warning.

If there are no registrations for the specified hostname, the response will
have code 404 (NOT FOUND), and have a string describing the error. If an error
occurs in the service, a response with code 500 (INTERNAL SERVER ERROR) is
returned along with a string describing the problem.


Monitoring works both for usage and storage records. For usage records the
machine name property is for resource name, and for storage records the storage
system property is used for resources. If a machine is registering both usage
and storage records it is not possible to distinguish between the two. The
newest registration will be used.

As with any other access to SGAS, the client needs to be permitted accessing
SGAS. For monotoring this in done in sgas.authz with the the "monitor" stanze,
e.g.:

"/O=Grid/O=NorduGrid/OU=ndgf.org/CN=ROBOT: Nagios"               monitor
