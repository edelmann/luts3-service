=== Configuring Host Scale Factors ===

From version 3.5, SGAS LUTS features a simple mechanisms for scaling cpu and
walltime. This is usefull in views and similar for properly comparing clusters
with their relative speed.

Configuration is fairly easy, in sgas.conf add a section called 'hostscaling',
and make an entry for each host, like this:

[hostscaling]
host.example.org=1.74
cluster.example.com=2.31

SGAS does not care about which benchmarks or other measuring charactaristica
you use, but you should of course use the same for all cluster in order to get
meaningfull data. Only one set of scale factors are supported.

Under the hood a table in database is created and the values are inserted when
SGAS starts. The table will be purged before inserting the values, so that only
values that currently exists in the configuration exists in the database.

The usagerecords and uraggregated views features columns which will scale the
cpu and wall values for the records. The column names are:

usagerecords: scaled_cpu_duration, scaled_wall_duration
uraggregated: scaled_cputime, scaled_walltime


If no value is defined for the machine, the value will be NULL. SGAS
intentionally does not feature a default scale setting, as this would not lead
to greater data quality or more information. If you want a default scale value,
it can be added in the query, like this:

SELECT sum(walltime), COALESCE(scaled_walltime, walltime*1.23) FROM uraggregated;

Enable Host Scale Factors as a plugin with the following section in the sgas.conf.

[plugin:hostscalefactors]
package=sgas.hostscalefactors.hostscale
class=HostScaleFactorUpdater
