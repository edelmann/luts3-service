A short survival guide to using PostgreSQL with SGAS:


## Checking the consistency of the aggregration table

Check that the following two quries give the same result:

SELECT sum(n_jobs) FROM uraggregated;

SELECT count(*) FROM usagerecords ;

If there exist rows in the uraggregated_table, some deviations should exist.
If the table is empty, the numbers should match EXACTLY!



## Triggering full aggregation regeneration

Stop sgas.

In the database shell:

TRUNCATE TABLE uraggregated;
TRUNCATE TABLE uraggregated_update ;
INSERT INTO uraggregated_update SELECT DISTINCT insert_time::date, machine_name FROM usagerecords;

And start SGAS to trigger the update run.

Technically this can be done with SGAS running, but I don't recommend it.
