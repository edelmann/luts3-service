SGAS NginX setup instructions
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

As of version 3.3, the preferred way to run SGAS is behind a reverse proxy,
specifically NginX. The reason for this is that there way some rare /
tricky-to-reproduce errors in pyOpenSSL. Secondly the view engine requires
serving of static files, which is not a task suitable for Twisted (though it
works fine, but it isn't the point).

NginX exists in most distributions package systems and is a fairly small
package to install.

Basically copy sgas.nginx to the nginx sites-enabled directory and set a couple
of values. The sites-enabled directory is typically located at
/etc/nginx/sites-enabled. Just call the file sgas, the .nginx suffix is just to
make it clear what it is.

In the file you need to set at least the server_name, which you should be the
FQDN of the machine. Furthermore you may need to set port (note that the port
number if both set in the listen directive, as well as in a header), and
directory for the SGAS web files.

For certificates the default grid locations are specified in the file. Note
that only one file client CAs can be set. By default it is set to 1f0e8352.0,
which is the NorduGrid CA. You may need to change this. It is possible to have
multiple client CAs by catting several CA files together into one file (the CA
typically end with .0).
