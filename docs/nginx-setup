SGAS NginX setup instructions
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

As of version 3.3, the preferred way to run SGAS is behind a reverse proxy,
specifically NginX. The reason for this is that there way some rare /
tricky-to-reproduce errors in pyOpenSSL. Secondly the view engine requires
serving of static files, which is not a task suitable for Twisted (though it
works fine, but it isn't the point).

NginX exists in most distributions package systems and is a fairly small
package to install.

Note: NginX version 0.7.65 has a bug which causes SSL session cache to fail
when using client certificates. This can bypassed by setting the Firefox config
value "security.enable_tls_session_tickets" to false (in about:config) or
installing a newer version of NginX.


== Installing & Configuration ==

Basically copy sgas.nginx to the nginx sites-enabled directory. The
sites-enabled directory is typically located at /etc/nginx/sites-enabled. Just
call the file sgas, the .nginx suffix is just to make it clear what it is.

Hereafter go through the values in the config file. Typically only the
server_name value has to be changed, which you should be the FQDN of the
machine. Furthermore you may need to set port (note that the port number if
both set in the listen directive, as well as in a header), and directory for
the SGAS web files, if you relocated SGAS.

For certificates the default grid locations are specified in the file. Note
that only one file client CAs can be set. By default it is set to 1f0e8352.0,
which is the NorduGrid CA. You may need to change this. It is possible to have
multiple client CAs by catting several CA files together into one file (the CA
typically end with .0).
